# Fit4Less-Bot

Pre-pandemic, there was never a problem with booking time-slots at my local Fit4Less gym.  However, with new restrictions due to Covid-19, time-slots have become increasingly difficult to book as there a limited spots.  Now has never been a better time to create a bot that automates the booking process to ensure a time-slot for yourself.  Noticing this booking problem, not only in myself, but with my friends as well, I believe this project will be to our benefit, and to anyone else who would like to utilize this tool.  Being open-source, you are free to use this code and make changes to your liking.  I hope you find it useful in some way.

This is a bot using Python and Selenium to automate the time-slot booking process.

Install selenium module

Install chromedriver, make sure it is in same directory as python script

Have fun.
